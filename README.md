# AXIONPBH

*Code and results for the assessment of the abundance of the DM axion in the presence of a modified cosmology.*

The key parts of the computation are:
* Calculation of the background evolution for the radiation and the PBH components;
* Calculation of the equation of motion for the axion field oscillating over the radiation+PBH cosmological background;
* Bisection method to obtain the axion mass from the present abundance.

The script for generating the results is in [`code/axionpbh_full.py`].
